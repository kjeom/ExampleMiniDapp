# Decentralized Statistics

This is a platform that enables the transparent statistics and surveys, allowing the contributors to get the rewards for participating in surveys. It's obviously contrast to a centralized statistics office.

This platform is inspired by a talk from [Ethcon Korea 2024](https://2024.ethcon.kr/), `The best way: correct number of the statistics`
