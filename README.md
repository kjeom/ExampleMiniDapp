This is a platform to make the survey and statistics transparent and for contributor get the reward from the survey. It's obviously contrast to centralized statistics office.

This platform is inspired by a talk from [Ethcon Korea 2024](https://2024.ethcon.kr/), `The best way: correct number of the statistics`
